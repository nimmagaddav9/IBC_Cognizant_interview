Technical Questions:
1. Can you explain the Backend for Frontend (BFF) architecture and why it is useful? 
Answer: The BFF architecture is designed to create a dedicated backend service specifically tailored for frontend needs. 
It helps optimize API responses and reduces frontend complexity by ensuring that data is formatted in a way that best 
suits the UI. This minimizes network calls and improves performance by delivering only the required data.

2. How do React hooks improve performance compared to class components? 
Answer: React hooks allow functional components to manage state and side effects without using class components. 
They help eliminate unnecessary re-renders and optimize performance by reducing the complexity of lifecycle methods. 
Additionally, useMemo and useCallback help prevent redundant computations and function recreations.

3. What is the difference between a REST API and GraphQL? 
Answer: REST API follows a predefined structure with multiple endpoints for different resources, 
while GraphQL allows clients to request specific data in a single query. 
GraphQL minimizes over-fetching and under-fetching issues, making it more flexible for frontend applications that
require precise data retrieval.

4. How do you handle authentication in a Node.js application? 
Answer: Authentication in Node.js can be implemented using JWT (JSON Web Token), OAuth, or session-based authentication. JWT is widely used for stateless authentication because it allows token-based authorization, making it scalable for microservices architecture.

5. What strategies do you use for performance optimization in React.js applications? Answer: Some strategies include:

Using lazy loading (React.lazy and Suspense).

Memoizing expensive computations with useMemo.

Optimizing re-renders with useCallback and React.memo.

Implementing virtualization for large lists (e.g., react-window).

Avoiding unnecessary state updates and reconciliation.

Behavioral Questions:
6. Can you describe a time when you had to debug a complex production issue? Answer: In a previous role, I encountered a performance bottleneck in a React application due to excessive state updates. Using React DevTools and profiling, I identified unnecessary re-renders caused by deeply nested components. By refactoring and optimizing state management, I reduced re-renders by 40%, significantly improving application responsiveness.

7. How do you handle conflicts in a collaborative development environment? Answer: I believe in proactive communication. When facing conflicts, I prefer discussing issues openly, understanding the perspectives of team members, and finding a solution that benefits everyone. In version control conflicts, I ensure proper branching strategies and use Git rebase or merge to resolve issues efficiently.

8. How do you keep yourself updated with new JavaScript and React trends? Answer: I regularly follow industry blogs, documentation, and official React and Node.js updates. I also engage in online communities, attend webinars, and experiment with new libraries to stay current with evolving best practices.
